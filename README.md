Wyandot (sometimes spelled Wendat) is the Iroquoian language traditionally spoken by the people known variously as Wyandot or Wyandotte, descended from the Huron Wendat. It was last spoken by members located primarily in Oklahoma, United States and Quebec, Canada. Linguists have traditionally considered Wyandot as a dialect or modern form of Wendat.
