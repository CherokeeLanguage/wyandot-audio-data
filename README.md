Wyandot (sometimes spelled Wendat) is the Iroquoian language traditionally spoken by the people known variously as Wyandot or Wyandotte, descended from the Huron Wendat. It was last spoken by members located primarily in Oklahoma, United States and Quebec, Canada. Linguists have traditionally considered Wyandot as a dialect or modern form of Wendat.

Wyandot essentially died out as a spoken language nearly a century ago, though there are now attempts at revitalization.

The Wyandot language is used in the television series Barkskins. 

This repository contains various audio sources for the language. Mainly for use with computational linguistics such as TTS and ASR, as well as being a resource for the creation audio teach exercises.
